Thai princess remarried into the fifth anniversary of the death of the American man , a five @-@ year @-@ old marriage broke down .
The seven @-@ year @-@ old Mir Sayion , who has been serving American as a US TV station , has been one of the most influential figures in the United States , but has been in the desert of the city of Las Vegas in the desert city of Louisiana for five years .
Mei Li @-@ an , a member of the Bahamas &apos; royal family in the Gulf country , risked his life into this banned love affair , and their marriage is like a fairy tale of two men , who once became a TV film .
However , according to a report by the State of Las Vegas , after five years , two people were asked to get divorced from the court , and Mei Li @-@ an filed a divorce with the court , trying to get married more quickly in the city .
The two of them met in 1999 , and at that time they were still professional soldiers and were stationed in Bahrain .
He realised that after this little princess , two men gave birth to the little princess , his life changed greatly .
Because the royal family prohibited this from being combined with Mei Li @-@ an , she gave her a silver jacket , a baseball cap , and she secretly brought her mother to the United States by wearing a silver jacket and wearing a baseball cap .
In the wake of the war with the US authorities , the couple finally got married at the age of 23 , while the young people were only nineteen years old at the age of 23 , while the new women were only 19 .
However , Johnson said that because of the temptation of Las Vegas , which was called the &quot; City of Verification , &quot; he and his wife , Mei Li @-@ an , were so nervous , and rumors spread the plot to assassinate his plot .
Johnson says that he is riding a hotel and a parking lot , and Mei Li @-@ an has gradually fallen into the nightmares of late at night and does not put his husband in the eyes of his eyes .
One year ago , Melleen threw away from the job .
Johnson says that her husband has already sunk .
Euro @-@ zone economic indicators to show the continued weakness of Europe &apos;s economy
Economists said that the economic index announced by the euro zone this week will show further evidence of economic confidence and lower economic output , while the UK &apos;s information is expected to show an increase in industrial activity .
They said that the economic output data of the euro @-@ zone economic output would continue to show great volatility , but the long @-@ term economic output would indicate a slowdown in economic growth .
The most important economic indicator this week will be providing evidence of the first economic confidence in December of this week in the ZEW Economic Research Institute , which is closely monitoring in Germany and the market .
The ZEW Index fell sharply from 31.3 percent in November to 13.9 percent .
Economists said that the substantial appreciation of the euro will continue to influence economic confidence in the near future , so there is no reason to predict that economic expectations will rebound back .
According to BNP economist , the main factor contributing to economic confidence , including the euro , uncertain factors in the global economy , and the unemployment rate in Germany , is unlikely to have a strong rebound during the December survey period .
According to a survey by economists from AFP &apos;s financial news AFX , this index fell to 11 in December from 13.9 % in December .
However , Joseph , the UBS Investment Bank , said that the German ZEW economic expectation index could even fall to zero in December .
&quot; The future expectations of German economic activities , based on our view , will continue to fall from ZEW &apos;s survey of analysts and financial market participants . &quot;
The crisis in Ukraine &apos;s crisis will become a topic of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe .
Russia has repeatedly accused the West of meddling in Eastern Europe affairs because Ukraine &apos;s political crisis became the focus of attention , and the annual ministerial conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation , tomorrow , will become a major topic .
Ukraine &apos;s strength is gradually expanding to Europe , where the Baltic Sea states , Georgia and Central Asia have already been discontented , and that the OSCE is likely to be an important topic in the two @-@ day meeting between the OSCE and the OSCE this time in Sofia , Bulgaria .
Ukraine &apos;s Supreme Court has made a dramatic decision that the European Union has appealed to the Organization of the Organization of Security and Cooperation ( OSCE ) to re @-@ vote for the second round of presidential elections recently .

The Bush administration &apos;s great test of the intelligence reform bill is going to be voted by the Congress this week .
The US Congress this week will make full use of the intelligence reform bill that President Bush is pushing for his second term , and his support for Republican Congressmen is the first time he will face a major challenge for the first time in his second term .
&quot; The problem of intelligence reform is that it wants to pass through Congress to pass the bill , which is that it needs to be approved by Congress , and it will be bad for the two @-@ party cooperation and the president &apos;s presidency , &quot; said Keith Kahn , former Republican state governor of New York , who is suffering from a terrorist attack on 11 September .
Keen said that if the president and the congress cannot deal with these problems , Congress will become more effective and we will be in trouble .
He told the New York Daily News : We had to wait for a long time before there would be another bill , with the support of both Republican and Democratic leaders , as well as the approval rating of 80 % of popular support .
Many members of Congress said yesterday that if the historical reform bill fails , it will delay the implementation of the old spy network system in the United States for several months or even a few years or even if it does .
Hamas , head of the House of Representatives of the House of Representatives of the House of Representatives , said at a cable news network that if the bill could not be passed this week , it would die .
The Congress will try again and again , on 6 and 7 days , to pass the fourth intelligence reform and terrorism prevention and control bill again , and then adjourn to early next year .
If the bill is not passed , the entire bill will be scrapped , and the Congress will be redrafted five years ago .
Ukraine &apos;s opposition insists on constitutional amendment
The pro @-@ Western opposition parties in Ukraine today insist that the opposition will not accept the re @-@ election of constitutional reform pushed forward by outgoing President Kuchi to resume the second round of presidential election .
This constitutional reform will deprive the most of the power of the president .
The Supreme Court is filled with defects in the second round of elections , announcing this election to be held on November 21 , with the failure of the Central Election Commission to reopen on December 26 , after which the opposition leader Yushchenko has been in a deadlock with Kuchi .
Yushchenko &apos;s ally , Tymoshenko , said : If the Amendment to the Constitutional Amendment is passed in the current way , all the power of the president will be transferred to Congress , which is unacceptable .
She told the reporter : &quot; We hope the president will be able to appoint the Director of Intelligence and Attorney General , so that we can carry out anti @-@ corruption efforts to wipe out the business of Ukraine &apos;s political and commercial industry . &quot;
Kumar , who maintained close ties with Russia , is worried that the opposition may win the presidential election , and to push forward the revision of the constitution before the re @-@ election .
The opposition congressmen refused to vote on the constitutional amendment proposed by the government yesterday , thus adjourned for 10 days .
According to the amendment , apart from the prime minister , defense minister , and the foreign minister , the heads of state will be transferred from the president to the Congress , and those who support the government now have close ties with the Congress .
According to the contents of this amendment , the president appointed by the president , the prime minister , defense minister , and the foreign minister may have to be approved by the Congress , and Congress can also present their own candidates .

Thousands of Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko has been in the capital Kiev for two weeks , surrounded the government building , surrounded the Soviet Union building a major footpath designed for the military parade , with the Congress elected to re @-@ elect the second round of presidential election on November 21 .
Yushchenko said tonight that members of the public who gathered in the capital &apos;s independence plaza should withdraw his government , reshuffling the election , and parliament and Kushima should agree to amend the electoral law to prevent election fraud .
&quot; Before making this decision , I could not talk about lifting the siege of government buildings or the Presidential Palace , &quot; he said in a speech to the opening ceremony of the campaign on December 26 .
For 14 days , this square has been demonstrating a love of Ukraine , as well as millions of citizens who can defend their choice of the Ukrainians .
He said : We are now applaud and applaud the whole world in our triumphant struggle , and the whole world is proud of Ukraine .

Egypt , Israel , Palestine and important international organizations , such as the United States and the EU , have reached important understanding , and agreed in principle to resolve the conflict between Israel and Palestine .

Hundreds of millions of children in the world suffer from AIDS under the war .
Over 1 billion children in the world are suffering from poverty , the war and the devastation of AIDS .
The United Nations Children &apos;s Fund said that the rights of children under the Convention on Child &apos;s Rights in 1989 had the right to live health and the protection of the living environment , and partly due to the fact that the governments of various countries failed to implement human rights and economic reforms .
In the annual report released by the UN Children &apos;s Foundation Executive Committee , Mrs. Becker said that more than half of the world &apos;s children grow in hunger and non @-@ health environments , and when schools become targets of attacks , as well as the destruction of the entire village , we have no way to fulfill its commitment to children .
He also said that the governments of many countries in too many countries would actually hurt children &apos;s intentions .
The UNICEF has compiled statistics from the British College of Economics and the University of Bristol , exposing the terrorist scene of children in large parts of the globe .
Researchers discovered that around 60 million children in the world are suffering from adequate access to safe drinking water , 400 million children will not be able to access safe drinking water , 240 million children will not be able to enjoy health services , and 100 million children have never been educated .
It pointed out that even more serious is that at least 700 million children suffer from hardship , including inability to get access to information and public health facilities , in a variety of ways .
The United Nations Children &apos;s Fund today published its 10th annual report , saying that war and AIDS are destroying all kinds of children &apos;s network , and children from time to time became direct victims of war and AIDS .
EU rejects EU &apos;s rejection of lifting arms embargo
The European Union today rejected the pressure from Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao , hoping to end the pressure on China &apos;s arms embargo as soon as possible , and said that it will make every effort to lift the 15 @-@ year embargo .
After the rotating president of the EU , the Netherlands , after the EU summit in China , made the above statement .
The Dutch said that the EU &apos;s approach to the embargo has been suspended , and there is no need for speculation .
The EU imposed sanctions against Beijing after the massacre occurred in Tiananmen Square in 1989 .
Although the issue of the arms embargo has been cast in the face of this China , the EU summit , the two sides will still sign a number of other trade agreements and other agreements .
Both China and the EU have claimed that these agreements have strengthened their own strategic partnership .
In a joint statement released after the summit with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao , the EU confirmed that the EU has confirmed its political desire to continue to lift the embargo .
The statement pointed out that the Chinese delegation welcomed this positive message and said this information is useful for the healthy development of China &apos;s all @-@ round strategic partnership between China and the EU .
At the press conference , Wen Jiabao said that the embargo failed to reflect the partnership between China and the EU .
Wen Jiabao said : This embargo is the result of the Cold War , not a reflection of the present situation , but has not reflected the partnership between China and the EU .
Under the leadership of France , some EU countries have pushed to lift the arms embargo , claiming that the ban is outdated .
In the absence of additional EU laws , people with foresight in the EU are worried that the lifting of the embargo may open up the flood gates of arms sales and encourage China &apos;s military power .
Dutch Prime Minister Barclom Barck said , &quot; I explain that the EU is willing to lift the embargo , but I also point out that lifting the ban and adjusting the norms of export of weapons are mutually connected .
Initial research found that folic acid may lead to breast cancer .
According to the latest health research report , pregnant women generally take the risk of being treated with breast cancer as a vitamins that are generally commonly used in preventing fetus .
But researchers say their research could only be because of a coincidence , because other studies suggest that folic acid will reduce the chance of breast cancer , so they urge pregnant women to continue to take this &quot; tonic . &quot;
Folic plants naturally exist in the deep @-@ colored leaves , known to be an important force in the development of embryonic embryos .
The women of British Bristol and Abratten have been following the 3000 women who took five milligrams of leaf or placebo during pregnancy in the 1960s , and most of them were in their second and third phases .
The report , published in the British Journal of Medicine , says that in September 2002 , women who took five milligrams of leaf acid breast cancer accounted for twice the rate of breast cancer .
One of the researchers is that the result is only a preliminary idea , and the goal is to further study the path of further research .
&quot; It is entirely possible that it will be a coincidence , so it is necessary to do research on further scientific studies before we reach any conclusion , &quot; he said .
Nanson said she hoped that the pregnant women would still be fed by their folic acid .
He said that the current dosage proposal and the dosage dose were quite different from the dosage .
According to British health standards , it is expected that pregnant women in the first phase of pregnancy will take 0.4 mg of leaf acid per day , more than ten times higher than the dose taken by women in the above study .

Yanukovych , who was originally the current president of the current president , has become a successor to a successor , and has changed his position to a candidate who is opposed to the opposition and the ruling party .
He says that I trust cowarists who worked under the government under the government , but now I feel disappointed , and the government is really shameful . &quot;
Due to the exchange of views with the opposition parties , some presidential powers have been transferred to Congress through revision of the law to end the two @-@ week massive protests and political chaos of the two weeks since the presidential election on November 21 .
Yanukovych , who had won the victory , was also elected invalid by the Supreme Court , which was declared invalid and re @-@ elected .

Before the disturbance , Oliver Feid wanted to talk to Turkey .
The film director , Oliver Stone , took the opportunity to reclaim his new name of Alexandria , an important place in the US , in order to rebuild the house with Turkey .
His classic film , which he wrote , has been used as a screenplay at midnight , and has been accused of destroying the Turkish image .
During an exclusive interview in this area , he told AFP : I &apos;ve never thought that this script will be hostile to Turkey , that is to oppose unfairness behavior in all places .
Turkish media have all along condemned Shi Dong since 1978 , after winning the award .
The film is adapted according to the memoir of Horns .
The US Young Seas was detained in Turkey for more than 30 years as a result of an attempt to smuggle marijuana from Turkey and a long period of legal proceedings .
The assailant of Turkey was accused of arbitrarily changing archipelins into a plays of racial discrimination , all the Turkish characters were described as evil eggs in the opera .
In the film , there are some horrible prison rape and abuse scenes .
Shih admits that perhaps because young people at the time were too young , they were too keen to express their views , so they were too strongly expressing their feelings .
But he added that Fuss indeed had been raped in Turkish prisons because he was relatively imprisoned for 30 years in jail because of his relatively humble crime , and all of them were based on facts .
&quot; From the very point of view , Turkey is not the only country that does not perfect a prison system , the United States also has similar problems . &quot;
Japan &apos;s GDP to slow down next year
Because of the increase in the value of the yen and the widening gap between the rich and the poor , the Japanese economy could slow down this year and into 2005 .
After a decade of stagnation , with the strong consumer spending of consumers and consumer spending , Japan has regained confidence again this year , but analysts point to China , while the political tensions between Japan and China are increasing .
As evidenced by the gradual decline of the Japanese economy , especially if the industrial production continues to drop , manufacturers have adjusted inventories to prevent excessive stockpiling .
According to the recently adopted new method , in the period of May to June , Japan &apos;s economy grew only 0.1 % in the first quarter of this year , and just as a result of the rapid economic downturn .
At present , economists still have a very different view of the rebound of the Japanese economy &apos;s reaction to Japan &apos;s economy .
According to the estimates , by the end of next fiscal year and next fiscal year , the real growth rate of the Japanese economy will reach 2.3 percent .
They call for a recovery year for the year 2005 , as follows : The US economy is recovering from a stable recovery track , and Japanese consumers have been able to make up the pace of slowing down exports .
Another pessimistic view is that UFJ is estimated to have a growth rate of only 1.8 % in the current fiscal year , and is lower than 0.6 % in the next fiscal year .
They raised potential risks , meaning that the profits of the manufacturer did not lead to their personal gains .
French FM : Middle East peace progress will test French @-@ US relations
French Foreign Minister Barnier said in his meeting with US Secretary of State Powell today that the resumption of the Middle East peace talks will test the relations of the two countries across the Atlantic Ocean .
Palestinian leader Arafat , after his death , appealed to the Palestinian side to quickly hold an international seminar to promote Israel @-@ Palestine peace process , but during the meeting , Bashar and Powell did not have any sign of an agreement .
Barnier flew to Washington from Paris to Washington , where he transferred to Brussels after lightning talks to attend a European Union summit .
Paris and Washington both agreed to mend the strained relations between the United States in the United States last year but to resolve the deadlock in the Middle East , and the differences between the two countries are still obvious .
Barnier said after US State Department talks with Powell , &quot; We want to improve Franco @-@ US relations , as well as future relations between Europe and the Americas . &quot;
He said , &quot; I believe that the test of the core relationship is the ability to promote the Palestinian @-@ Israeli peace process . &quot;
Barnier has earlier called for an early convening of an international conference on the Middle East to make use of the window of opportunity created by Arafat last month .
However , Powell still refuses to make a commitment .
He said that the two sides talked about the holding of a meeting between the British and the Palestinians , but did not mention whether an international meeting would be held .
US officials have indicated that their primary mission is to promote peace between Israel and Palestine and ensure the smooth progress of the Palestinian election next month .

Tokyo , Japan to Hold FTA Talks in January
Japan and South Korea kicked off negotiations early next year on a free trade agreement ( FTA ) between Japan and the Republic of Korea ( FTA ) , Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura said Wednesday .
&quot; Because Tokyo and Seoul authorities hope to sign free trade agreement by the end of 2005 , the two sides should resume their talks as early as possible , &quot; he said .

During the Cold War , North Korea kidnapped a number of Japanese nationals , and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi is facing the enormous pressure that the people demand to punish North Korea .
Following Japanese researchers last week , the Pyongyang authorities were furious that the victims of the two hostages were not covered by the remains of two hostages , and that the families of the victims were furious .
Apart from the kidnapping problem , Koizumi and Roh Moo @-@ hyun agreed unanimously to resume the six @-@ party talks on developing nuclear weapons as soon as possible .
The three rounds of the six @-@ party talks , which have been held since North Korea &apos;s secret development of nuclear weapons , have been held in October 2002 , have failed to produce concrete results .
The North &apos;s subsequent boycott was originally scheduled to be held in September of this year in the fourth round of six @-@ party talks .
Six of the six @-@ party talks are South Korea , North Korea , the United States , China , Japan and Russia .

Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra entered the second four years of his term at the end of his four @-@ year term , but he is confident that his second term will be able to win his second four @-@ year term , but his popularity has been damaged because of his inability to quell the separation of the separatists .
Thailand &apos;s general election is scheduled to be held on February 6 next year when Thaksin and his political opponents are making active preparations , and most analysts believe that he will win victory despite serious violent clashes and avian influenza outbreaks in the south this year .
A total of 12 people died of avian influenza in Asia this year , but in Thailand , especially in Thailand , the Thai government admitted that it had made mistakes in dealing with the epidemic .
On the other hand , how much of the problem doesn &apos;t make enough for Thaksin to be reelected ? &quot; In contrast , &quot; what is the significance of his choice of a Muslim insurgency in southern Taiwan ?
President of the House Committee of the Senate , Clyshin , told AFP : The phenomenon here is how you look at Thaksin , and he now enjoys the popular support of the public .
He said : Next year , the situation will begin to collapse , and if you look at the accumulation of his family , the accumulation of the people around him , and the social inequality and violence .
Due to social inequality and violence , the riots in most of the southern part of Thailand are in the hands of the majority of people in Thailand , which have been occurring since the beginning of this month .
Since January this year , Islamists have regarded Buddhists , government officials , and security forces as their targets , and they also carried out bomb attacks and decapitation operations so far , more than 560 people have died and one hundred have disappeared .

The threat from Israel has triggered a wave of support for Arafat &apos;s support , and &apos; Arafat received several groups of supporters .
Abdullah led Arafat to shake hands with these people , and they came to express their support to Arafat &apos;s siege of Arafat .
On September 25 of last year , Arafat received two groups , one of them came from the world , advocate peace @-@ free mobile phone groups , and the other is a group of political activists .

Bo @-@ wu died on December 14 after a stroke .
On the way to the graveyard , women and children crying in tears were throwing flowers into the flowers .
Due to the warning given by Minister of Justice Gong Zubo , some people may take advantage of the funeral of funeral services , and so they acted as roadblocks with large @-@ scale shipping containers with large ships .
&quot; It has been reported that a reliable intelligence report said that some people were conspiring to use the funeral and burial opportunities to select people against the government .
However , armed forces spokesman Basque Huazhong University said that the coup plot in the military deployment of the armed forces was obviously transformed .
Arroyo later walked out of Malan Palace , greeting the local military police .

Armitage once again exerted greater pressure on Syria when he was interviewed by Arab reporters .

This US State Department 2nd figure pointed out that Damascus should fulfill the UN Security Council &apos;s resolution passed in September this year to stop all interventions in Lebanon , Lebanon , as soon as possible .
Armitage said that Syria &apos;s return to the United States is not against the United States , but to the entire international community .
In January next year , when the United Nations Security Council discussed whether or not the United Nations peacekeeping troops would continue to be stationed in Lebanon , would the United States turn Syria &apos;s rejection of cooperation into discussions ?
On the Iraq issue , Armitage admitted that Damascus is indeed taking a number of US expectations , such as strengthening border patrol with Iraq and blocking the source of the insurgents .
However , he also pointed out that Syria also needs to make greater efforts to carry out its work .

Putin Says Acquisition of Inaugurates Capital to Protect National Interests
Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out today that the Russian acquisition of the main assets of the Russian oil giant YK was to protect its national interest , and that this is the first post @-@ nationnationalization action of the post @-@ Soviet era in the post @-@ Soviet era .
At a press conference held at the Kremlin at the end of the Kremlin , Putin said that Russia &apos;s state @-@ run oil company was acquiring Uprs &apos; oil and natural gas company that Russia is now using an absolutely legal market mechanism to protect its national interests .
I think this method is completely normal .
Russia &apos;s state @-@ run oil company today became the new home of Ewing Petroleum , Inc. today after a secret auction to Yugansk oil and natural gas company .
The Russian state @-@ run oil company suddenly announced late last night that it had the 100 per cent stake in the 100 @-@ bit Baral Financial Group .
The acquisition has enabled the Kremlin to firmly control Russia &apos;s vital energy industry .
Over the past 18 months , the Russian authorities have been attacking YuX Company and his family of billionaire kowski .
Russia &apos;s state @-@ run oil company is merging with Russia &apos;s state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ generation oil and gas company , combined with the combined control of one @-@ fifth of the nation &apos;s total natural gas production and the entire natural gas production , becoming the biggest energy group in the global economy .
Putin used to attack the privatization of a state of black box in the 1990s , to defend the country &apos;s current procurement campaign .
The privatization measures made it possible for Russia to be the most valuable asset of the Russian economy , falling into the hands of a few of the lambar @-@ ridden businessmen such as Hawkovski .
Bertha Financial Group bought at approximately $ 9.35 billion , bidding to control the control authority of Yugansk .

UN : Disaster @-@ relief materials required weeks for disaster victims
Emergency relief materials will be transported to Indonesia &apos;s Aceh province in the hands of a few weeks later , the United Nations said Tuesday .
The US Navy helicopter arrived at the city of Greater Asia , the capital of Aceh , and the city &apos;s more and more field hospitals were operating and a large number of relief supplies were also arriving at the airport .
However , Aum Quuster , the head of the UN Liaison Office in Indonesia , told reporters that because of the complex coordination and infrastructure , the relief materials could not be quickly transported .
After returning to Jakarta , Aamquist told reporters that he could send the relief goods to all its isolated areas after a few weeks of returning from his return to the capital city of Jakarta .
He said that this is a worrisome issue , and we are trying to do everything possible to establish a system of payment for a large @-@ scale gas distribution system .
The United Nations and other relief organizations have already warned that if the residents of Sumatra disaster areas in Indonesia &apos;s Sumatra are not immediately receiving clean drinking water and food supply and medical treatment , they may die in a few days .
&quot; I hope the disaster victims will be able to find food and drinking water , but this is obviously not what we see . &quot;

Japan provides 500 million US dollars in relief funds
Japan has become the world &apos;s worst victim of tsunami aid since it promised to provide 500 million U S dollars in aid for the victims of the world &apos;s worst disaster in the Indian Ocean , and Japan &apos;s contribution to disaster relief and reconstruction has increased to more than $ 1.6 billion .
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said in a statement that Japan , being the largest economy in Asia , will consider providing more assistance including money and technology .
He said that Japan will do its best to provide assistance in three areas : Financial resources , intellectual technology , and human resources .
He said : Japan will temporarily grant a donation of 500 million US dollars for disaster @-@ stricken countries and related international organizations to provide emergency relief for the disaster .
Koizumi also said that he will attend world leaders &apos; meeting in Jakarta , Indonesia , on the 6th to discuss aid for the victims of the tsunami .
After US President George W. Bush was criticized for slow response to this human catastrophe , the US government has raised ten times the amount of aid to US $ 350 million yesterday .
China , which has been seen to be increasingly interested in challenging Japan &apos;s influence in Asia , has promised to provide 60.5 million US dollars for the development of developing countries .
Koizumi said that Japan will mobilize helicopters and personnel of the fire department to make more contributions .
Japan will also consider making some efforts to do so as soon as possible , including the use of aircraft , warships , and personnel of the Japanese Self @-@ Defense Force .
Japan has previously promised to provide $ 30 million in aid from countries affected by the tsunami .
The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Koizumi &apos;s $ 500 million dollar also included this $ 30 million dollar .
50 bodies to be provided in Indonesia &apos;s Aceh medical assistance
The World Health Organization said today that 50 aid groups have arrived in Indonesia &apos;s Aceh province to prepare medical assistance for survivors of the tsunami @-@ stricken areas .
Winston Petersen , Indonesia &apos;s representative to the World Health Organization , said that the WHO is trying to coordinate all its organizations and also held meetings with them this afternoon .
Peterson said that it was difficult to coordinate with many groups to carry out disaster relief directly in Aceh .
Peterson said in a telephone interview in Jakarta : &quot; We are trying to get out of the mind , every organisation is coming to , but each of them is willing to cooperate with each other . &quot;
Peterson reiterated that the WHO &apos;s main concerns were to prevent outbreaks of diseases such as cholera , dysentery , and other diseases that could cause tens of thousands of people to die .
&quot; We are very worried because we have many people homeless , they do not have clean drinking water or appropriate food , &quot; said Peterson .
Therefore , the conditions for the outbreak of infectious diseases are all in place .
However , Petersen stressed that there have been no signs of these diseases .
The Ministry of Health said that in the tsunami , the number of deaths in Sumatra could reach 100,000 , and most of the victims were in Aceh .
Since the majority of the medical facilities in Aceh have been destroyed , in the past week , the Indonesian government has set up at least eight field hospital hospitals , and the United Nations Children &apos;s Fund ( UNICEF ) has started to send basic medical bags to help 200,000 children .
Powell Expects the Shia to win in Iraq &apos;s general election
US Secretary of State Powell predicted today that the Shiite faction will win in the upcoming Iraq election , but he also believes that since the Shiite and Shiite parties in Iraq are not in harmony , they do not want to increase Iran &apos;s influence in Iraq .
More and more indications show that Mori is likely to boycott the general election on January 30 because the authorities in Iraq are prohibited from attending the general election because of spreading the insurgency .
Powell said at the American Broadcasting Corporation that the new government , which will be the ruling party , will select the majority of Shiites .
The majority of Iraq &apos;s population are also Shiite .
Shiite Muslims account for more than 60 % of the population in Iraq , and most of them live in southern and central .
Mori is born in central and western China , accounting for 20 % of the population .
&quot; The election is expected to be held on schedule , &quot; Powell said .
Powell also said that he felt that the future Iraqi government under the influence of the Shia control meant that Iran would manipulate the Iraqi political situation .
He said : I am now thinking that even if Iran &apos;s influence is likely to have Iran &apos;s influence , Iran will naturally try to influence the Iraqi political situation , Iran and the Iraqi Shia side have a large difference , and in the past it also had serious inroads and conflicts .
International help wave after wave of tsunami victims
The rescue forces currently in the disaster @-@ stricken areas in the disaster @-@ stricken areas are building a net water supply system to help the millions of victims in millions of families to return to the famine .
According to statistics , the number of deaths has risen to nearly 150,000 .
The relief goods provided by the governments of various countries are endless , and US President Bush has entrusted his father , Bush , and former president Clinton , who will be responsible for raising private donations .
As to the delegation led by Secretary of State Powell , the delegation arrived in Thailand last night to arrive in Thailand last night for the progress of US concern and assessment of relief efforts .
Powell and his party include President Bush , the governor of Florida , Jack Bush , and the Director General of the US Department of International Development .
Powell will lead a delegation to inspect the disaster in Thailand , Indonesia , Sri Lanka and return to the summit .
Powell said that the purpose of his visit was to evaluate the disaster situation , to observe the disaster situation , to observe the United States &apos; plan to do so , and to immediately promise to increase more aid in addition to promised $ 350 million .
So far , there are thousands of tourists who have abandoned the search for the whereabouts of their whereabouts , many of whom are foreign tourists .
However , Thai Prime Minister Thaksin vowed to continue his country search .
&quot; Foreign experts told me that they might be buried in the mud in mangrove areas , &quot; he said , adding that we will continue to go all out to search for them .
The largest @-@ ever international rescue operation continues to take place in the history of the history .
The navy helicopter dispatched by the US aircraft carrier , the USS Lin Kenen , has carried out the second day of air @-@ dropping rescue and survivors in Aceh , Indonesia .
Maj. Gen. Krad , commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Forest Command , said that 50,000 pounds of food and water have been transported to the disaster @-@ stricken areas , and the mission is smoothly carried out .
Victory for the Tsunami Disaster Relief Here
At a time when disaster relief for the tsunami disaster hit the disaster area in the disaster area , a rather light activity was also secretly carried out : The governments of various countries are investing in that aspect , that aspect should be given assistance , and that aspect should be motivated by that side of the modern relief action .
This disaster caused nearly 150,000 lives , including the struggles between the United States , the United Nations , and Europe , and the struggle for the dominance of the leading position in Asia .
But disaster relief experts still cling cautiously , believing that the tsunami hit too many countries , which could lead to a precedent that the promised countries that promised to provide aid will be able to fulfill their promises .
&quot; The aid commitment made by governments of various countries has never been 100 % timely . &quot;
The donations made by the governments of various countries totaled as much as $ 2 billion , including UN Secretary General Annan , Secretary of State Powell , and other international political figures , including US Secretary of State Powell , and the leaders of China and Japan to hold a political dialogue summit in Jakarta on 6 September .
US President George W. Bush has put U.S. President George W. Bush in a more than ten @-@ fold increase of US $ 350 million after being exposed to rich countries .
In Asia , the Tsunami disaster triggered a secret commitment to regional influence , and the loss of $ 60.5 million in aid to a developing country , this is a big hand .
Japan , which has been reducing its foreign aid budget for six years in a row , has strove to smash the country &apos;s rising national strength , and has promised at least 500 million US dollars in aid and the number of other countries is weak .
World leaders have visited Sri Lanka one after another to inspect the disaster .
A Sri Lankan official said that leaders of other countries including UN Secretary @-@ General Kofi Annan and US Secretary of State Powell have arrived in Sri Lanka to take part in the massive tsunami disaster in the end of last month , including UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and US Secretary of State Powell .
They said that Powell has arrived here , and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hae @-@ chan will arrive soon .
The press release said that Powell will visit some areas of the worst possible areas of the tsunami last December , including the US Marine Corps , which are stationed in Galk , the southern part of the rescue operation .
The South Korean embassy said that Lee Hae @-@ chan will visit the western coast of China as accompanied by Prime Minister Sri Lanka .
Under the joint statement , the prime minister will visit the west coast , personally observing the lives , lives , and property losses incurred in the west coast , the statement said .
Lee Hae @-@ chan will stay in the most serious situation to monitor South Korea &apos;s non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organizations to take charge of relief operations .
UN Secretary General Annan is scheduled to arrive in the two days for a two @-@ day visit .
He said that he will visit southern and eastern China , where he will be accompanied by the president of the World Bank , Watson , president of the World Bank , who is scheduled to visit South Africa and the eastern part of the country .
The Secretary @-@ General of the World Health Organization , Mr Li Zhongyu , will also arrive today .
The German foreign minister is scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka on Saturday .

These leaders , including Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin , announced yesterday that Martin will visit Sri Lanka and Thailand later this month .

Annan &apos;s visit to sri lanka in Sri Lanka against rebels
UN Secretary @-@ General Kofi Annan said today that he hopes that every day he will return to Sri Lanka , where he will visit every local area in the country .
At the end of his two @-@ day visit to the Scandinavia region , Annan said that the Slovakian government had prevented him from visiting the northern area controlled by the rebels .
In a press conference , Annan said that he wanted to return to the country where he could visit all parts of the country and help accelerate the peace process .
Kofi Annan said that the president of Kumamura is a member of the Middle East , who is opposed to his involvement in guerrilla operations , because she is worried that the rebels will use his visit as a political bargaining chip .
He said : I have put forward the issue of the peace process and the necessity for strengthening the peace process .
I also discussed this matter with President Kumaratama .
&quot; It is impossible for him to visit the rebels in the city of Yakasa , the rebel region controlled by the rebels , and hundreds of people protested at Yafener &apos;s office . &quot;
However , the Slovakian government firmly denied media reports , saying that the media had misled the matter .
On the other hand , at the time when people from all walks of life go all out for disaster relief work , NASA &apos;s meteorological unit warned that the country &apos;s coastline may be hit by a typhoon , and the current typhoon is in the vicinity of coastal waters .

The Japanese media ignited war on the NHK program .
It is rumored that the public @-@ owned Japanese Broadcasting Corporation ( NHK ) has been under pressure from the political sector , and in the last few years a series of Japanese forces fighting comfort women in the wake of World War II will be shrinking , and Japan &apos;s liberal media will respond to this and stand conservative .
It was said that after discussions with high @-@ level politicians in the political and political circles , NHK &apos;s plan to cut off the contents of this program was deleted mostly from those who criticized Japan &apos;s wartime actions and the victims of Japanese war crimes , and the liberal media criticized NHK for its method of criticizing NHK .
However , the conservative newspaper argued that the company &apos;s senior executives had a responsibility to ensure that the contents of the program are fair and objective .
This dispute erupted last week , the crucial part of the program , which was in 2001 , a mock trial aimed at the Japanese army &apos;s violent comfort women .
The trial was held by a women &apos;s rights group in Tokyo in December 2000 , and the final verdict was held in December 2000 by Emperor Yue @-@ jen , the Emperor of the Japanese occupation of Japan , allowing the Japanese army to use comfort women during the Japanese occupation of Asia at that time .
Historians say that at least 200,000 young women were forced to become comfort women in the front line , mostly from South Korea , China , the Philippines , and Indonesia .
Director of the NHK &apos;s Democratic Progressive Party , Shinzo Abe , and Chew Chong , who were in charge of the program , expressed concerns over the contents of the program before the program was aired .
According to Evergreen , the higher level of NHK will then begin editing and reducing the contents of the program .
He said that CNHK is lower than political pressure .
Abe and Nakagawa admitted that they had met with NHK staff who told them that they wanted to be fair , but they firmly denied that they were pressuring them to put pressure on them .
Euro zone data show core inflation control
Economic data for the euro zone this week will show that core inflation is still under control , economists said .
Meanwhile , industrial production and consumer spending in the euro zone are expected to fall .
It is expected that the rate of inflation will rise from 2.2 percent in November to 2.3 percent in December .
However , the increase largely reflects the increase in the tobacco tax , while the core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9 % .
The figures for the core inflation and the consumer prices will be released together .
Economists pointed out that core inflation in the prices of food , energy , alcoholic drinks and tobacco has been maintained between 1.6 % and 2 % in the past two years .
Terry Hsieh , president of the European Central Bank , said on the 13th that the short @-@ term price pressure has been lowered recently .
Inflation will remain at no more than 2 % in the next few months , but lower than before the end of the year .
At the same time , another economist said that in view of the slowdown in Germany &apos;s growth , the November 18 euro zone , which was released on 18 February , is expected to lower in view of industrial production in November .
Germany &apos;s industrial production dropped by 1.7 percent in November , but economists told economists that the euro @-@ zone industrial production fell 0.5 percent in October and by 0.4 percent in November .
&quot; Industrial production in the euro zone is expected to rebound in December . &quot;
The bureaucracy has been hit twice in a second strike by the tsunami victims .

Indonesia originally asked foreign troops to take part in humanitarian relief missions within three months , but then to recover this requirement .
In Thailand , Canada , Sweden , Norway , and Finland , they will discuss reconstruction plans and identify the bodies of bodies .
However , the survivors are facing new difficulties , such as the deep @-@ rooted bureaucratic workstyle of Indonesia , obstructing relief supplies from around the globe .
In a small village near Daisian , capital of Sumatra , the capital of Indonesia &apos;s Sumatra Island , fisherman Man Brady said : The tsunami has caused us to lose weight , and we lose everything and face hunger .
He said : When we saw those food , clothes , and other relief materials made in Aceh in television ?
Like other victims in the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims , they lost their identification cards and other official documents so that they could become a nightmare .
Even though he asked officials how to handle them everyday , the results were the same , and they couldn &apos;t receive savior .
